## 📦 Tables

- `products` – inventory items with price and descriptions
- `categories` – item groupings
- `suppliers` – supplier contact information
- `inventory` – stock levels by location
- `purchase_orders` – orders placed to suppliers
- `order_items` – individual product breakdown of each order

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
